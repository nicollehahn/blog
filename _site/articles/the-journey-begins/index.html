        <p>I’ve come a long way in the past year.  Last June, I enrolled in Betamore Academy.  It’s an incubator space for both education &amp; provides a physical workspace for entrepreneurs, start-ups, remote workers, that sort of thing.  What did I do?  I took the course in Front End Web Development.  Topics included HTML, CSS, JS, responsive web design for mobile and tablets, all of which is covered in a 10 week course.  10 WEEKS!!!  It was a great introduction to my future.  Was I in over my head?  Most of the time!  I have to admit, I was incredulous that it was such an effort for me to learn the new ways.  I was exhausted after the class.  Most of it was caused by me stressing over not grasping the material immediately.  At the time, I didn’t have much confidence, so I didn’t ask for help.  I was angry at myself.  So much money spent, how could I have utilized my time better???</p>

<p>My next step after the course was to get better at time management, learn to focus, and study/practice so that I could understand everything that was taught to me.  In addition to that, I began taking many classes on CodeSchool, Treehouse &amp; Pluralsight.  I watched seminars, webdev classes online, and streamed many similar things on my AppleTV or MacBookPro.  It was a site called DevTips, by an energetic guy named, Travis Neilson.  I loved how goofy he was.  I loved how he loved what he was doing.  His site pointed out some great resources that began to set me on my way.  In my next post, I will share what resources started to make me realize I could do this and as Dr. Seuss says, “you have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You’re on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who’ll decide where to go…” (from Oh, The Places You’ll Go!)</p>
