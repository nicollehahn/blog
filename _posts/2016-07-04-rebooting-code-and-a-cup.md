I've been working all along on coding.  About a month ago a good friend of mine said "it's great that you tell me what you are doing & learning.  But why aren't you blogging about what you've learned?"  That stopped me.  Why not?  When I thought about what she said over dinner, I realized it was because I didn't think anything I was doing was important enough to blog about.  Much has happened since I began the website & the blog.  I *have* learned a lot.  But how would anyone know unless you've talked to me?  One year ago I began a blog and a site and that's about all the effort I put into that.  The site is a little behind on personal information now.  The blog never got started.  Sigh...

What I have planned for Code and a Cup is to *wing it*, blogging, if you don't mind.  I need to "feel" what seems right for me to blog about.  To find that out, it will take some or many posts until it fits just right, kind of like breaking in denim.

Before picking up "Code and a Cup" again, I have been doing a Tumblr blog called "CatLegs" with another friend.  It started because my friend's 8 year old cat, Haruki, developed a neurological disorder that (one of the symptoms was) his paw turns inward.  She began sending me pictures of just his legs featuring the affected paw.  Being my quirky self, I returned the favor by sending her pictures of my cats legs.  One night while coding, she texted me.  I got Haruki's progress report and one thing led to another....  We began creating crazy quotes by inserting "cat legs" in awkward spots.  I sat laughing hysterically at my phone in between all the crazy quotes and pictures we were sending each other.  We knew we had to blog about it, even if we were the only ones who'd enjoy the posts.  I picked Tumblr over Instagram because you could have posts that were text only, it would emphasize our inane quotes.

Having fun doing that, made me realize one thing, I was approaching coding all wrong.  I wasn't having fun.  I loved learning and working on projects, but I pushed myself too hard, getting into complicated code, before learning the basics really well.  I have been taking time, slowing down and doing things well, so that when I begin to "trick out" my coding style, it will be less frustrating.  Since I've done this, I've been really enjoying my time on the computer again.  I get up at least an hour before I would normally on workdays and spend some time coding. I spend a half hour at lunch working on something.  Most importantly I've returned to some other hobbies like exercising, reading and watch foreign films again.  My other path was leading to frustration and burnout before I ever got where I wanted to go.  I think this new path is going to be way more adventuresome <>
