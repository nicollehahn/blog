"Fear is only as deep as the mind allows."
						~Japanese Proverb
						
I've begun my next full-fledged website for Francesca &amp; Co. travel.  It's been interesting so far.  I'm using some gems with Middleman like Sass, Bourbon, Bitters, and Liveflow.  The navigation bar has taken me a really long time to sort out.  I'm trying to do it by hand and on my own.  I make it, I break it and so forth....

I've been preparing myself for the next stage in my life.  It's scary, but exciting.  I love learning.  I love solving puzzles.  If anything I've learned by now, when it gets tough on the screen, walk away from it.  A couple minutes or an hour makes a difference in how I look at the problem (which unfortunately is still waiting for me).

"Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging."
~Joseph Campbell

Now bitten by the bug, I've been focusing entirely on coding.  It's wonderful to spending my time on something I really enjoy.  It's become my world.  

My latest problem to reflect on:  how to remain focused when everything else is unsettled?  Along with Googling what Ruby gems to install, I take a little time to be thankful for what I have.  Sometimes I get completely lost in data and pixels.  I guess that happens sometimes....  I need to keep treating this as a passion and not an escape.
