### Day 003 : June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I spent today mostly how to set up code-yhblock in my Jekyll powered blog which uses Kramdown.  It was pretty frustrating trying that out.  Many many attempts later the basic “>” worked.  My code is centered instead of left aligned.  That’s my next blog challenge.  I’m hoping that I like Spike enough to switch my site & blog to that instead of Jekyll.  As I am learning more Javascript, I’d rather being practicing that instead of using rusty ruby skills.

After some frustrating time, I went to work on Spike.  I love the live reloading that’s built into Spike.  It saves me time, keeps things clean and simple since it’s already embedded in Spike.


**Thoughts:** Nothing like reading the dox to whatever you are using.  Thanks to [kramdown syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)
