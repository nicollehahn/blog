“Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.” – Andre Gide

 And that's how it began.  I decided to try to learn something new.  I have always been drawn towards technology.  I love digging under the surface.  I love the "search."  Who doesn't love that feeling, when you have driven yourself crazy looking for something, there it is?  The treasure is in front of you, whether it's a solution you had to search for, or something you figured out through trial and error.

 I often tell people that I know my way around D.C. so well because I got lost there so many times.  My approach to webdev seems no different.  I've traded learning languages to speak in foreign countries, to learning languages to speak to a broad community of developers, designers, programmers and people in the tech community.  It will be through this experience, that a new adventure begins.
