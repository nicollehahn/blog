### Day 004-6 : June 14-16, 2017

**The Last Few Day's Progress:** I really have had a rough time with Spike.  There isn’t much documentation yet, so I regressed to using Roots.  Roots is what came before Spike.  Both are products from [Carrot](http://carrot.is/).  It relies on Jade, Stylus & Coffee script.  I’m comfortable using Jade.  The problem with Spike and Roots was that not all Node Modules were downloaded with the program.  I went back & put each in first globally and then directly in the file I was working on.  Everything came together after that.  That took the last few days of trial and error.  Lots of error if I may be honest.

**Thoughts:** I stuck with Roots since there was more documentation for me to follow.  More than likely I will move on to Spike with the next site.  For today, I’ve spent my time creating Jade/html.  Tomorrow will begin for styling process.  I can't hold onto Roots because it has an expiration date.  Roots is being used more for experience and it should make my next experience with Spike more palatable.
