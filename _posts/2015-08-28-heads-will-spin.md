They don't tell you when you get into Web Development that many times you will feel as if things fly right over your head ---- or after much learning and coding, your head will keep spinning.

I wish I could say that the feeling stops which it does but ....... I think you enjoy feeling that way so you seek out more ways to experience it. Why else would I decide to do Rails when I barely have Ruby down?  Did I mention while pursuing the above I am in a responsive web design & development class, adding SASS to my languages?  Did I mention Jekyll?

Take a gulp & keep on spinning!
