We came into this chemo with a little trepidation. Dr. Donehower would let us know about Wayne's CEA count.  They normal range is 3.0 or below. Prior to treatment, Wayne's number was 17. We were upset at how high the number was.  Dr. Donehower said even though it was high, the numbers could have been a lot worse. As long as Wayne's system responded to treatment, his chances of conquering the cancer demons looked optimistic. I am proud to share with you that he dropped from **17 to 7** with 2 chemo treatments!!!  Even the chemo nurses were happy when they saw his numbers. 
We thank you for keeping Wayne in your prayers. Someone above is definitely listening.
