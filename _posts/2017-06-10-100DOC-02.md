### Day 2 : June 10, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress:** I missed CharmCityJs this past week.  Luckily I get twitter notification emails.  I always love something new to learn.  Tom Kraak was giving a talk on the Spike static site generator.  I’ve been looking for a modular approach that’s powered by js than ruby.  I understand js more than ruby, so it might be quicker for me to discover and solve problems.  Why does Spike interest?  Honestly?  I loved the name just like I loved Jekyll.  Sometimes my shallow reasons turn out to discover a meaty choice.  

One thing I had to do was update npm & node.  First I updated npm:
    <pre><code>npm -v (to see which version you have)
    npm -v npm install npm@latest -g (installs the latest npm update)(to see which version you have)
    npm -v (ensures your install was a success)</code></pre>

To update Node, you’ll need npm’s handy n module. Run this code to clear npm’s cache, install n, and install the latest stable version of Node:
    <pre><code>sudo npm cache clean -f
    sudo npm install -g n
    sudo n stable</code></pre>

After your node is up to date, then go ahead and install spike.
    <pre><code>npm install spike -g</code></pre>
Cd into the directory you’ll be working in.
    <pre><code>spike new <projectname></code></pre>
Once that’s loaded, make sure your terminal is in the working folder.
    <pre><code>spike watch</code></pre>
This is great because it does a live reload and will show up in your browser via browsersync!
