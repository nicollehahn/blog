**Today's Progress:** Working on JavaScript: Up and Going

**What happenned to you?:** Well, a lot of self-doubt, questioning and all the stuff that gets in the way of process!  For shame!!  So I've sucked it up and am back in the game.  I had my hand in too many web development pots.  I couldn't focus.  Now I'm specifically focusing on Javascript, as well as maintaining my chops with html & css.  

**Thoughts:** It only took three different times to feel at ease with Javascript.  In the beginning I felt really intimidated just thinking I'd be working in Js, and now it seems a natural part of web development, the missing link.  Front End felt so one-sided, so I like the interaction that Js brings to a site.  Trying hard not to get ahead of myself & just get the basic elements.

**Link to work:** No links today.  Just all practice on [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
